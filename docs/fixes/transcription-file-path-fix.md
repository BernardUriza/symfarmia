# 🔧 Fix: Transcription File Path Mismatch

## 🚨 Problem
The transcription feature was failing with "ENOENT: no such file or directory" because Next.js and SusurroTest microservice were using different directories for file uploads.

## 🎯 Root Cause
- Next.js API: Sends file content via FormData to microservice
- SusurroTest: Saves uploaded files to `microservices/susurro-test/uploads/`
- Issue: The uploads directory didn't exist or wasn't using absolute paths

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Multer Configuration** (`microservices/susurro-test/server.js`)
```javascript
// Use absolute paths
const uploadsDir = path.join(__dirname, 'uploads');

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    // Ensure directory exists before saving
    ensureDirectoryExists(uploadsDir);
    cb(null, uploadsDir);
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const timestamp = Date.now();
    // Sanitize filename to avoid path issues
    const sanitizedName = file.originalname.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '_');
    cb(null, `${timestamp}-${sanitizedName}`);
  }
});
```

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added file existence verification
- Better logging with absolute paths
- More descriptive error messages

### 3. **Directory Creation on Startup**
```javascript
// Ensure directories exist when server starts
ensureDirectoryExists(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads'));
ensureDirectoryExists(path.join(__dirname, 'test-audio'));
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests in Build Guardian
The file path fix is now validated by unit tests integrated into the build guardian system:

```bash
# Run full build guardian (includes all tests)
npm run build:guardian

# Run just the microservice E2E tests
node scripts/microservice-e2e-guardian.js
```

The tests verify:
- ✅ Uploads directory exists and is writable
- ✅ Files are saved with absolute paths
- ✅ Server file transcription works
- ✅ File upload transcription works
- ✅ Uploaded files can be found at expected paths

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Start microservice
cd microservices/susurro-test
npm start

# In another terminal, test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/transcribe-upload \
  -F "audio=@test-audio/sample.wav"
```

## 📁 Directory Structure
```
symfarmia/
├── uploads/                    # Next.js temp files (if any)
└── microservices/
    └── susurro-test/
        ├── uploads/            # Microservice uploaded files
        └── test-audio/         # Test audio files
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements
1. Use shared volume for Docker deployments
2. Implement file cleanup after processing
3. Add file size and type validation
4. Consider streaming for large files
