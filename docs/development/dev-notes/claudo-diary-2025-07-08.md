# Claudio Diary â€“ July 8, 2025 (Condensed)

- 4:35 AM: cleared 46 TypeScript errors from modular architecture
- Removed `React.FC` usage; switched to plain functions
- Created missing demo and medical AI files
- Updated enums to union types; fixed array annotations
- Hook signatures aligned for compatibility
- Result: build compiles; only ESLint warnings remain

**Next steps**
- Clean ESLint warnings
- Finish missing components
- Test medical AI end-to-end

*"46 errors at 4 AM? Challenge accepted."*
