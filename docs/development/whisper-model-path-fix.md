# üîß Whisper Model Path Fix - Using Pre-existing Models

## üêõ Problem

Build failure on Netlify with TTY error:
```
Error: Not running in a terminal, skipping interactive setup
```

The `npx nodejs-whisper download` command was trying to use interactive prompts which don't work in CI/CD environments.

## üîç Root Cause

1. **Models already exist** in `public/models/` directory
2. **Download command uses TTY** for interactive selection
3. **CI/CD has no TTY** causing the build to fail

## ‚úÖ Solution

### 1. **Remove Model Downloads**

Updated `netlify.toml`:
```toml
# Before: Tried to download models
command = "... && npx nodejs-whisper download base && ..."

# After: Uses existing models
command = "... && echo '‚úÖ Using pre-existing models from public/models/...' && ..."
```

Removed `postinstall` from `netlify/functions/package.json`

### 2. **Update Functions to Use Model Path**

Both Netlify functions now specify the model path explicitly:

```javascript
// Set model path - in Netlify, the public folder is accessible from the function
const MODEL_PATH = process.env.NETLIFY
  ? path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'models', 'ggml-base.bin')
  : path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'models', 'ggml-base.bin');

// Use in nodewhisper
const result = await nodewhisper(audioPath, {
  modelPath: MODEL_PATH,  // Instead of modelName: 'base'
  // ... other options
});
```

### 3. **Pre-existing Models**

The project already includes:
- `public/models/ggml-base.bin` (~148MB) - Multilingual base model
- `public/models/ggml-base.en.bin` (~148MB) - English-only base model
- `public/models/manifest.json` - Model metadata

## üéØ Benefits

1. **No TTY Issues** - No interactive prompts during build
2. **Faster Builds** - No need to download 148MB models
3. **Consistent Models** - Same models in dev and production
4. **Version Control** - Models are part of the repository

## üìù Notes

- Models are committed to the repository (148MB each)
- This increases repo size but ensures reliability
- Alternative: Use Git LFS for large model files
- The `modelPath` option overrides `modelName` in nodejs-whisper

## üß™ Verification

Run locally:
```bash
./verify-whisper-setup.sh
# Should show models in public/models/
```

Check Netlify build logs for:
- "Using pre-existing models from public/models/..."
- No download attempts
- No TTY errors
