# 🔧 TypeScript Build Error Fix for Netlify

## 🐛 Problem

Build failure on Netlify with error:
```
It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed.
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

1. **TypeScript packages are in `devDependencies`** (which is correct)
2. **Netlify sets `NODE_ENV=production`** during build
3. **`npm install` skips devDependencies** when NODE_ENV=production
4. **Build fails** because TypeScript packages aren't installed

## ✅ Solution

Modified the build command in `netlify.toml` to force installation of all dependencies:

```toml
[build]
  command = "... && npm install --production=false && ..."
```

The `--production=false` flag tells npm to install both dependencies AND devDependencies, regardless of NODE_ENV setting.

## 📝 Details

### Before:
```bash
npm install  # Skips devDependencies in production
```

### After:
```bash
npm install --production=false  # Installs all dependencies
```

## 🎯 Why This Works

- TypeScript is a build-time tool, so it belongs in devDependencies
- Netlify needs TypeScript to build the project
- Using `--production=false` ensures all build tools are available
- The production bundle doesn't include devDependencies anyway

## 🚀 Alternative Solutions (Not Used)

1. **Move TypeScript to dependencies** - Not recommended, bloats production
2. **Use `npm ci`** - Also works but requires package-lock.json
3. **Unset NODE_ENV temporarily** - More complex, same result

## ✅ Verification

After deploy, check Netlify build logs for:
- TypeScript packages being installed
- No TypeScript-related errors
- Successful build completion
