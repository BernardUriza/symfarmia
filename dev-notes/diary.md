## 🔄 **RECENT COLLABORATION HISTORY**

### 2025-07-08 04:35 AM - Architecture Rescue
- **Claudio**: Fixed 46 TypeScript errors in modular architecture
- **Handoff**: Stable codebase ready for medical AI testing
- **Energy**: High despite 4:35 AM coding session

### 2025-07-08 04:25 AM - Build Monitor Fix
- **Codex**: Resolved build monitor recursion issue
- **Solution**: Changed to `npm run build:original`
- **Duration**: 10 minutes, medium energy

### 2025-07-07 - Major System Overhaul
  - **Claudio**: Complete Redux → Zustand migration
  - **Claudio**: Medical design system implementation
  - **Claudio**: CI/CD pipeline with intelligent automation
  - **Codex**: Modular architecture foundation

### 2025-07-10 10:00 AM - DashboardLanding Audit
- **Codex**: Audited DashboardLanding component usage.
  - Found `src/components/DashboardLanding.jsx` only used in `MinimalistLandingPage` for demo landing.
  - Confirmed dashboard route uses `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (`DashboardPage`) instead of DashboardLanding.
  - Added `<h1>BRUTAL TEST</h1>` to `DashboardLanding.jsx` to test visibility.
  - Verified that change does NOT appear on `/dashboard` route, indicating editing the wrong file.
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Next Steps**: Adjust demo landing behavior or update correct dashboard entry point as needed.
