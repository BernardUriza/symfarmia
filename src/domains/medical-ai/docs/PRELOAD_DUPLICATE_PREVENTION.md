# Preventing Duplicate Preload Notifications

## Problem

When navigating between routes, the WhisperPreloadInitializer component was showing loading/success notifications multiple times, even when the model was already loaded.

## Root Causes

1. **Component Remounting**: Each route change causes the component to unmount and remount
2. **Local State Reset**: The `hasShownSuccess` ref was local to each component instance
3. **Missing Initial Check**: Component wasn't checking if model was already loaded on mount

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Global Success Flag in WhisperPreloadManager

Added a persistent flag to track if success toast was shown:

```typescript
interface PreloadState {
  // ... existing fields
  hasShownSuccessToast?: boolean;
}

// New methods
markSuccessToastShown(): void
hasShownSuccessToast(): boolean
```

### 2. Enhanced Initialization Check

```typescript
initializePreload(options?: {...}): void {
  // Don't initialize if already loaded or currently loading
  if (this.state.status === 'loaded' || this.state.status === 'loading') {
    console.log(`[WhisperPreloadManager] Skipping initialization - status: ${this.state.status}`);
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

### 3. Component-Level Guards

Added `wasAlreadyLoaded` ref to track if model was loaded on mount:

```typescript
const wasAlreadyLoaded = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const currentState = whisperPreloadManager.getState();
  if (currentState.status === 'loaded') {
    wasAlreadyLoaded.current = true;
    console.log('[WhisperPreload] Model already loaded, skipping all notifications');
  }
}, []);
```

### 4. Toast Display Guards

All toast effects now check `wasAlreadyLoaded.current`:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!showToasts || wasAlreadyLoaded.current) return;
  // ... toast logic
}, [...]);
```

## Behavior After Changes

### First Visit
1. Component mounts → Model not loaded
2. Shows loading toast
3. Model loads → Shows success toast once
4. Success flag is set globally

### Subsequent Route Changes
1. Component mounts → Detects model already loaded
2. Sets `wasAlreadyLoaded.current = true`
3. Skips all toast notifications
4. No duplicate messages

### Manual Refresh
1. Singleton state persists during navigation
2. Model remains loaded in memory
3. No unnecessary reloading

## Testing

1. **Initial Load**: Visit app → Should see loading + success toast once
2. **Navigation**: Navigate between routes → No duplicate toasts
3. **Console**: Check for "[WhisperPreload] Model already loaded" message
4. **Performance**: Model loads only once per session

## Benefits

- ✅ No duplicate notifications
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Singleton pattern working correctly
- ✅ Model persists across routes
- ✅ Reduced unnecessary network requests
