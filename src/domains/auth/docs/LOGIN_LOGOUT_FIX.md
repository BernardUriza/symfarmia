# Login/Logout and Landing Page Fix

## Problems Identified
1. **No Logout Button**: The application had Auth0 authentication configured but no visible logout button
2. **Landing Page Never Shown**: The landing page was automatically redirecting to dashboard when in demo mode

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Logout Button
Created a new `LogoutButton` component:
- Location: `/src/components/layout/LogoutButton.jsx`
- Features:
  - Clears localStorage (theme, patient data)
  - Redirects to Auth0 logout endpoint (`/auth/logout`)
  - Clean UI with icon and hover states
  - Dark mode support

### 2. Added Logout to Dashboard
- Added LogoutButton to DashboardLanding header
- Positioned next to the system status indicator
- Users can now logout from the dashboard

### 3. Fixed Landing Page Redirect
- Removed automatic redirect to dashboard when in demo mode
- Users can now see the landing page content
- Added navigation header to landing page with:
  - Dashboard link
  - Try Demo button
  
### 4. Updated Demo Login Flow
- Demo login now redirects to dashboard (not just adding ?demo=true)
- Sets demo mode in localStorage for persistence
- Cleaner navigation flow

## Navigation Flow

### Before:
1. User visits `/` → Immediately redirected to `/dashboard`
2. No way to logout
3. Landing page content never visible

### After:
1. User visits `/` → Sees landing page with navigation
2. Can click "Dashboard" to go to dashboard
3. Can click "Try Demo" to enter demo mode
4. Can logout from dashboard using logout button

## Auth0 Integration
The application uses Auth0 with these routes:
- `/auth/login` - Login endpoint
- `/auth/logout` - Logout endpoint  
- `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback
- `/auth/me` - User info endpoint

## Testing
1. Visit the root URL (`/`) - should see landing page
2. Click "Dashboard" - should navigate to dashboard
3. Click logout button - should clear session and redirect to Auth0 logout
4. Click "Try Demo" on landing - should enter demo mode and go to dashboard
